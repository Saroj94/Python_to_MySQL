# Description of Code
 -  This Python script provides a streamlined and efficient approach to inserting large datasets in a CSV file format from python into a MySQL database table. Here’s a detailed overview of its functionality and advantages:

# Functionality

###	1.	Database Connection:
- The script establishes a connection to a MySQL database using the mysql.connector library, allowing seamless interaction with the database.
##	2.	CSV File Handling:
- It reads data from a specified CSV file (myoriginaltable.csv), utilizing Python’s built-in csv module. This enables the script to handle various CSV formats and efficiently process large datasets.
##	3.	Dynamic Insert Query Construction:
- The script dynamically constructs an SQL INSERT statement based on the headers of the CSV file. This flexibility allows it to adapt to any changes in the CSV structure without requiring hardcoded SQL statements.
##	4.	Handling Empty Values:
- It includes a mechanism to handle empty or missing values in the data rows. The script replaces empty strings or None values with NULL, ensuring that the database remains consistent and avoids errors during insertion.
##	5.	Batch Insertion:
- The script efficiently inserts each row from the CSV file into the specified MySQL table (mydatabasetable). This method is typically faster than manual imports through MySQL’s import wizard, especially for large datasets.
##	6.	Transaction Management:
- The script commits the transaction after all insertions, ensuring data integrity and allowing for rollback if needed.
##	7.	Resource Management:
- After completing the insertion process, it closes the cursor and database connection, which is crucial for resource management and preventing memory leaks.

# Advantages

- $Speed$: Inserting data programmatically through Python is often significantly faster than using MySQL’s import wizard, especially for large datasets. The script can process thousands of records in a matter of seconds.
- $Reusability$: This code can be easily adapted for different CSV files and database tables by modifying the file path and connection parameters. It can serve as a reusable template for various data import tasks.
- $Error Handling$: By managing empty values directly in the code, the script minimizes the likelihood of errors during data insertion, ensuring a smoother import process.
- $Flexibility$: Users can modify the script to accommodate additional data processing, such as transforming or validating data before insertion.
